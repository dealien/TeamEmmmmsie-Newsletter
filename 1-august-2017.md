# Newsletter Introduction

Hello, TeamEmmmmsie! I’m proud to announce the release of our first official team newsletter! Until now, the team hasn’t had a central news source, so most news came from posts from various mods on Twitter and Discord. As a result, people often didn’t know what was news and what wasn’t. Many of our members were left oblivious to important announcements and the many wonderful support opportunities this team has to offer.

Through the newsletter, it is our hope to create a central, reliable, and entertaining source of information for all our members. We plan to provide interesting and informative content such as the history of TeamEmmmmsie, reports of any changes that affect the community, success stories from you and your fellow members, and information about upcoming team events.

The newsletter is for the community, and as such, we want to hear from you too! We endeavor to make ourselves as accessible as possible, and we encourage you, our readers, to send us all your questions, comments, suggestions, pretty much anything. We also plan to offer a column called the “Community Article.” For this column, we will randomly select a topic from a pool of reader-submitted possibilities. If there’s a team-relevant topic you think would be of interest to people, let us know!

We're currently working hard to finish preparations and ensure the success of this project. We're also looking for additional writers for the newsletter. For more information, please contact [VyrenGames](https://www.twitter.com/VyrenGames) on Twitter or through the TeamEmmmmsie Discord.
